# MIMIC-III Feature Extraction and Label Generation

We used FIDDLE to extract features from the MIMIC-III dataset. The most up to date version can be found here: https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/mld3/FIDDLE. The original MIMIC-III extraction code can be found here: https://github.com/MLD3/FIDDLE-experiments.

The version used for this paper is not the most up do date version, but is included here for convenience.

## To Use FIDDLE

1. Change the file config.yaml by replacing the empty strings with the instructions next to them.
2. Run the file run_fiddle.py. It has no required arguments.
